# Final-Year-Project
The project involves developing a network-like what-if model based on causal analysis to help understand the impacts of changes within a system. By employing this model, it is expected that when someone wants to adjust an account to understand its impact, this network will reveal the necessary steps to make changes to that node. Additionally, the model will uncover the accounts affected by those changes, providing a comprehensive understanding of the system's behavior. 
For example, consider the planning of a backyard barbecue. By utilizing the model, it can be observed that an increase in the number of guests (a causal factor) will result in a greater amount of food required, which will subsequently lead to an increase in the total cost. Specifically, if an additional 5 guests are invited, the model predicts that 10 more burgers will be needed, and an extra RM20 will be spent. This causal analysis facilitates an understanding of the direct and indirect effects of decisions, enabling more accurate and efficient planning.
This project can be divided into two phases: causal analysis and what-if analysis. The former aims to identify the cause-and-effect relationship between financial accounts, which will be referred as variables in this context. The latter aims to estimate and analyse the impact of changes in variables, predicting the potential outcomes of different decisions on financial statements.
